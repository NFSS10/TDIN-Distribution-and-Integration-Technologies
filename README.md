## Project 2 - An enterprise distributed systems
This second project lead us to develop of a platform using WCF Services and MSMQ. This platform is used by a company in order to solve problems that are presented as "Trouble Tickets". These tickets are then given to a "Solver" that has the function of solving these tickets. The solver can also send questions to other departments of the company to help him solve the problem.
